# Stellar Ping Pong Game

A simple game of ping pong in space (actually that makes no sense but whatever).

You can find the code itself in the folder "1st Game", or the game itself with songs in the folder "Stellar Pong Game".

# To be able to play this game, you need:
- RayLib 5.0 (in the C:/ disk) ; ( https://www.raylib.com )
- Visual Studio Code (to change the code or see what it looks like) with the C/C++ extension
- MinGW as the compiler (v6.3.0 or later, and in the C:/ disk)

The configuration to make Raylib 5.0 work with VS Code is already done in the folder, so you don't need to do it youself.

# Version 1.2 (Mid January 2024): 

- Game ends with a text saying that you beat the game (obtainable with a score of 40)
- My name on the top right corner :)

# Version 1.3 (10th February 2024):

- Changing musics depending on the score (no way ?!)
- Changing backgrounds depending on the score
- Starting window showing you how to control the platform

# Updates for the Version 1.5

- Goddamn asteroids !
- Saving progress and scores
- Only one background image, but a moving one

# Issues / Future changes

- v1.3 = the background images could make your game run around 40 FPS, at least that's my case. Hope it's only for me...
- The incrementation of the score variable is too high for now. It's gonna be "score += 1", for the final version
