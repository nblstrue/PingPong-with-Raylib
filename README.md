# Stellar Ping Pong Game

A simple game of ping pong in space (actually that makes no sense but whatever).

You can find the code itself in the folder "1st Game", or the game itself with songs in the folder "Stellar Pong Game".

# To be able to play this game, you need:
- RayLib 5.0 (in the C:/ disk) ; ( https://www.raylib.com )
- Visual Studio Code (to change the code or see what it looks like) with the C/C++ extension
- MinGW as the compiler (v6.3.0 or later, and in the C:/ disk)

The configuration to make Raylib 5.0 work with VS Code is already done in the folder, so you don't need to do it youself.

# Version 1.2 (Mid January 2024): 

- Game ends with a text saying that you beat the game (obtainable with a score of 40)
- My name on the top right corner :)

# Version 1.5 (10th February 2024):

- Changing musics depending on the score (no way ?!)
- Changing backgrounds depending on the score
- Starting window showing you how to control the platform

# Version 2 (14th February 2024):

- Saving progress in "spg.save"
- score incrementation from 10 to 1
- When the ball x = 0, the score decrementation is -3
- My OC with my name during the game

I think i will leave the game in this state. I'm kinda out of ideas, because the difficulty is hard enough, maybe too hard and the backgrounds add horrible lags. Even tough the save is a little bit rough, i'm happy with this project.

Next one is gonna be a platformer with a team that i will create (hopefully) and i will go beyond
