# Stellar Ping Pong Game

A simple game of ping pong in space (actually that makes no sense but whatever).

You can find the code itself in the folder "1st Game", or the game itself with songs in the folder "Stellar Pong Game".

# To be able to play this game, you need:
- RayLib 5.0 (in the C:/ disk) ; ( https://www.raylib.com )
- Visual Studio Code (to change the code or see what it looks like) with the C/C++ extension
- MinGW as the compiler (v6.3.0 or later, and in the C:/ disk)

The configuration to make Raylib 5.0 work with VS Code is already done in the folder, so you don't need to do it youself.

# Issues / Future changes

- v1.3 = the background images could make your game run around 40 FPS, at least that's my case. Hope it's only for me. (not gonna be dealt with sadly...)
- The incrementation of the score variable is too high for now. It's gonna be "score += 1", for the final version
