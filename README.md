# Stellar Ping Pong Game

A simple game of ping pong in space (actually that makes no sense but whatever)

# To be able to play this game, you need:
- RayLib 5.0 (in the C:/ disk) ; ( https://www.raylib.com )
- Visual Studio Code (to change the code or see what it looks like) with the C/C++ extension
- MinGW as the compiler (the lastest the version, the better)

The configuration to make Raylib 5.0 work with VS Code is already done in the folder, so you don't need to do it youself

# Version 1.2:

- Game ends with a text saying that you beat the game (obtainable with a score of 40)
- My name on the top right corner :)

# Version 1.3

- Changing musics depending on the score (no way ?!)
- (It has been 3 versions and we aren't in space yet... That's tragic)

# Updates for the Version 1.5

- Changing backgrounds
- Goddamn asteroids !

  Have fun i guess
